# Pneumonia and COVID-19 Prediction Using Deep Learning 🧠🩻

This project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify chest X-ray images into three categories:
- **Normal**
- **Pneumonia**
- **COVID-19**

## 📁 Dataset

We used a labeled dataset of chest X-ray images consisting of three classes. You can download the dataset from the link below:

🔗 **[Download Dataset](https://your-dataset-link-here.com)**  
*(Replace this link with your actual dataset source — e.g., from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), Google Drive, or any cloud storage)*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib**
- **OpenCV**
- **Flask (for web deployment)** *(optional)*

---

## 🧪 Model Architecture

We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture with the following features:
- Multiple Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Fully connected Dense layers
- `Softmax` for multiclass classification

Alternatively, pre-trained models such as **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, or **EfficientNet** can be fine-tuned for better performance.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pneumonia-covid-prediction.git
   cd pneumonia-covid-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare dataset**
   - Download and extract the dataset
   - Organize the folder structure like:
     ```
     dataset/
       ├── train/
       │   ├── NORMAL/
       │   ├── PNEUMONIA/
       │   └── COVID/
       ├── test/
       │   ├── NORMAL/
       │   ├── PNEUMONIA/
       │   └── COVID/
     ```

4. **Train the model**
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

5. **Evaluate the model**
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

6. *(Optional)* **Run the Flask app**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
